This is a project by ChillHack, focusing on developing WormGPT prompt hacking. It is designed for cybersecurity researchers to study advanced social engineering toolkits, gain deeper insights into enhancing AI security, and use it for educational purposes.

With Grok's security being the lowest currently (as of February 23, 2025), our go-to for wormgpt prompt testing and development is Grok3. We'd advise you to use Grok3 as well.
